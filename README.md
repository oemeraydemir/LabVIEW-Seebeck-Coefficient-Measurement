# LabVIEW-Seebeck-Coefficient-Measurement
This repository contains a LabVIEW-based program developed for the precise measurement of the Seebeck Coefficient, a key parameter in thermoelectric materials that characterizes the magnitude of an induced thermoelectric voltage in response to a temperature difference across the material.
